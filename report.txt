Project 4 Report

I was able to finish all of the project.
I did not use any banned STL components.
I don't have any bugs that I wasn't able to fix (at least I don't think so).

How I tested each class:

For the PersonProfile, AttributeTranslator, and MemberDatabase classes, I created
toString() methods that would print out the contents of my data structures.
I first tried making PersonProfiles manually in the command line and seeing if
its information was being stored correctly. For MemberDatabase's collection
of members and AttributeTranslator's collection of AttValPairs, I made text files
testmembers.txt and testtranslator.txt that had a small sample of 
members.txt and translator.txt, respectively. I then used those as input files to
test the loading functions in both classes. I also used those files to test
MatchMaker. To test my Radix Tree, I first made a dummy implementation with a map,
recorded the results, and then compared the results with my implemented RadixTree.
